# 2-Player-Game

This project is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with React. It includes a user-friendly interface that allows players to select their choice, compare it against a randomly generated CPU choice, and display the scores. The game is interactive, visually appealing with dynamic styles, and provides a refresh button to reset the game.

## Features

- **Game Choices**: The user can select from "STONE", "PAPER", and "SCISSOR" options.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the scores for both the user and the CPU.
- **Random CPU Selection**: The CPUâ€™s choice is generated randomly.
- **Game Results**: The game determines the winner based on the standard rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- **Reset Game**: A refresh button resets all choices and scores.

## Game Rules

- **Stone beats Scissor**
- **Paper beats Stone**
- **Scissor beats Paper**
